##Unit 1: How to get started: your first program

####Introducing the Web Crawler
A web crawler is a program that collects content from the web. A web crawler finds web pages by starting from a seed page and following links to find other pages, and following links from the other pages it finds, and continuing to follow links until it has found many web pages.

Here is the process that a web crawler follows:

* Start from one preselected page. We call the starting page the "seed" page.
* Extract all the links on that page. (This is the part we will work on in this unit and Unit 2.)
* Follow each of those links to find new pages.
* Extract all the links from all of the new pages found.
* Follow each of those links to find new pages.
* Extract all the links from all of the new pages found.
* ...

This keeps going as long as there are new pages to find, or until it is stopped.

In this unit you will be writing a program to extract the first link from a given web page. In Unit 2, you will find out how to extract all the links on a web page. In Unit 3, you will see how to keep the crawl going over many pages.

###Programming 

**Programming** is the core of computer science.

A **computer** is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.

A **program** describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.

A **programming language** is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer.

**Python** is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the input to the Python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.
