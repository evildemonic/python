# Python


### Information

I am currently teaching myself programming, starting with Python. I have zero
programming experience, with no background in IT or CS. I am using GitHub to store 
notes and code from online courses, books, videos and other sources with eventual 
plans to start my own projects. I am hoping that by using GitHub I'll be able to see 
my progression as I learn, and to share this journey with friends (or even potential
employers later once I have a few languages under my belt). I have a long way to go, 
so please bear with me. 

Even though my repositories are public, please note that I am not going to accept
pull requests at this time. For starters, these repositories are strictly for me
to keep track of things while I learn. However, feel free to contact me at any time 
should you have any questions, comments, or feedback of any kind. I welcome criticism, 
and would love to hear from others who are currently learning Python (or other new 
languages) as well!
