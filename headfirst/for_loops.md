For loops:

```python
fav_movies = ["The Holy Grail", "The Life of Brian"]

print(fav_movies[0])
print(fav_movies[1])
```
To continue the above code, use a **for** loop:

```python
fav_movies = ["The Holy Grail", "The Life of Brian"]

for each_flick in fav_movies: 
    print (each_flick)
```


```python
for each_item in movies:
    print (each_item)
```

While loops:

```python
count = 0
while count < len(movies):
        print(movies[count])
        count = count+1
```
