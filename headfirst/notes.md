###Head First Python Notes

#####Lists

```
movies = ["The Holy Grail", "The Life of Brian", "The Meaning of Life"]
```

To print out items in the list: 

```
print(movies[#])
```
(Python starts counting from 0.)

**Editing a list:**

Add a single data item to the end of the list with **append()**; remove data from the end of the list with **pop()**, and add multiple items to the list with **extend()**.
